SysDB is still in early development but it already provides unique features.
The following list describes the most important features of SysDB:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hostname canonicalization:</b> Before storing host-names in the
internal data store, they may be canonicalized. This way, different names
provided by different backends may be mapped to the same object in SysDB.</li>
<li><b>Simple, yet flexible object-types:</b> Each object (host, service,
attribute) stored in SysDB is automatically attributed with last-update and
interval information allowing for detecting out-of-date entries. Host and
service attributes support different types: integer, decimal, string,
date-time, binary.</li>
<li><b>Simple query language:</b> (Not to be confused with SQL, the Structured
Query Language used by relational databases.) Objects in SysDB may be queried
and retrieved using a simple, domain-specific query language.</li>
<li><b>Multi-threaded, event-based architecture:</b> Client connections are
handled using an event-driven design allowing for handling many connections
with low resource footprint. The SysDB core is multi-threaded allowing for
good use of processing resources.</li>
<li><b>Modular, configurable architecture:</b> Most functionality in SysDB is
provided by plugins. All support for data backends is implemented that way and
may dynamically be loaded and (re)configured at runtime. The core
functionality may be extended using various hooks.</li>
<li><b>Custom extensions:</b> Through its plugin architecture, SysDB may
easily be extended for any special use-case.</li>
</ul>
