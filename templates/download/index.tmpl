<p>
SysDB is distributed as a source-code archive.
</p>

<h2>Stable Release</h2>

<p>
<b>Latest release:</b> 0.1.0<br />
<b>Release date:</b> tba
</p>

<h2>Development Snapshots</h2>

<p>
The latest version of the source-code is available in the Git archive, hosted
on Github. You may browse the source-code in the <a
href="https://github.com/tokkee/sysdb">web-interface</a> or download the code
via <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> via <a
href="https://github.com/tokkee/sysdb.git">https://github.com/tokkee/sysdb.git</a>.
</p>

<h2>Compile the Source</h2>

<p>
After downloading the source package, you need to unpack, compile, and install
the source. For this, you might need additional dependencies based on which
components of SysDB you want to use. You'll find detailed information about
this in the <a
href="https://github.com/tokkee/sysdb/blob/master/README">README</a> file.
Also, the '<span class="tt">configure</span>' script will provide a summary of
required and auto-detected dependencies.
</p>

<p>
Compile and install the source using the usual approach used by a lot of Open
Source projects:
</p>

<pre>
tar zxf sysdb-<i>VERSION</i>.tar.gz
cd sysdb-<i>VERSION</i>
./configure
make all install
</pre>

<p>
When fetching the source from Git or after changing the build system, you'll
have to rebuild the build system:
</p>

<pre>
./autogen.sh
</pre>
