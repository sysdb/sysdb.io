2014-06-01: Version 0.1.0
-------------------------

This is the initial release of SysDB. It provides the following core features:

* *sysdb*: A terminal-based, interactive client program. Supports
  line-editing and history based on libreadline or libedit and uses an
  asynchronous, event-driven architecture to handle user input and server
  replies simultaneously.
* *sysdbd*: The database backend service configurable through a configuration
  file. The daemon supports online reconfiguration.
* *core*: Flexible, multi-threaded core architecture providing a configurable
  plugin infrastructure for querying external data-sources and extending
  core functionality. The following plugin types are supported:
** data collection
** hostname canonicalization
** logging
* *store*: Central, in-memory object store managing host and service objects
  and their attributes. Host names may be canonicalized through respective
  plugins. Each object is automatically attributed with last update and
  interval information using nano-seconds resolution. Attributes may have
  various types (integer, decimal, string, date-time, binary).
* *frontend*: The frontend handling client connections uses a multi-threaded,
  asynchronous, event-driven architecture capable of handling multiple
  listen addresses.
* *query language*: The store may be queried using the ‘LIST’, ‘LOOKUP’, and
  ‘FETCH’ commands returning JSON formatted objects.
* *utils*: A rich set of abstract data-types and utility functions for
  internal use:
** generic channels for asynchronous, multi-threaded I/O
** DBI wrapper to ease common database access operations
** thread-aware error handling and reporting
** doubly linked-lists
** dynamic sized memory buffers supporting formatted strings and binary
** data
** UNIX socket client implementation
* *documentation*: Full documentation for the tools, all plugins, and the
  query language provided as manpages and HTML pages.
* *testing*: Unit and integration tests exist for most parts except plugins
  covering 77% of all functions. Valgrind and Clang's address sanitzer are
  used to detect memory leaks and programming errors.

The following plugins are shipped with this version of SysDB:

Backends:
~~~~~~~~~
* *collectd::unixsock*: Query collectd through its ‘unixsock’ interface
* *mk-livestatus*: Query arbitrary (monitoring) systems using the Check_MK
  Livestatus interface.
* *puppet::store-configs*: Query Puppet through its “stored configuration”
  database.

Plugins:
~~~~~~~~
* *cname::dns*: Canonicalize hostnames by querying DNS information.
* *syslog*: Send log messages to the system log service.
