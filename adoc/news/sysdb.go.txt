-----------------------------------------------------------

A few days ago, the first version of Go bindings for SysDB have been pushed to
link:https://github.com/sysdb/go[github.com/sysdb/go]. The project provides a
set of packages for the link:https://golang.org/[Go] programming language
(golang) which implement a SysDB client and helper functions for handling the
front-end protocol.

Install the package into your GOPATH using the
link:https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Download_and_install_packages_and_dependencies[go
get] command:

-----
go get github.com/sysdb/go
-----

The documentation is included with the source code in a way compatible with
the link:https://golang.org/cmd/godoc/[godoc tool] and the latest version can
be viewed link:https://godoc.org/github.com/sysdb/go[online].

At the moment, the following packages are available:

* *client*: A SysDB client implementation.
* *proto*: Helper functions for using the SysDB front-end protocol. That's the
  protocol used for communication between a client and a SysDB server instance.
* *sysdb*: Core constants and types used by SysDB packages.
