--------------------------------------------------------

This release focuses on simplifications and more flexibility in the frontend
and the query language. Most of those changes are not backward-compatible but
easy client implementations.

* *sysdb*:
** Include priority when printing log messages.
** Fixed handling of empty queries.
* *store*:
** When serializing the entire store (LIST command), return an array of host
   objects (rather than wrapping it into another object).
** Fixed JSON format of time-series data.
** Fixed error checks of invalid compare expressions and reject them.
** Fixed lookups by back-end name.
** Added support for comparing attributes with different types by comparing
   their string values.
* *frontend*:
** Clarified details about asynchronous messages and authentication options and
   made client implementation more robust.
** Introduced a new message type encoding the JSON serialized response of a
   query and its data type.
** Include the priority in log messages.
** Include object types in FETCH, LIST, and LOOKUP messages.
** Added support for including services and metrics in LIST responses and skip
   hosts without the respective children.
* *query language*:
** Added support for services and metrics to LIST command.
** Changed syntax for attribute lookup to 'attributes[<name>]'.
** Changed syntax for accessing queryable fields to '.<field>'.
* *utils*:
** strbuf: Improved memory management.
