--------------------------------------------------------

This release features support for metrics and transparent access to a
backend's time-series data. Some backward-incompatible changes were applied to
some query commands for more consistency.

* *build system*:
** Added checks for format strings and arguments.
** Changed configure option for collectd::unixsock to
   --enable-collectd-unixsock.
* *core*:
** Added support for “metric” objects which may be assigned to a host.
** Introduced support for handling time-series data: added new data structures
   describing time-series data and a new type of plugins called “time-series
   fetchers” which are used to access time-series information.
* *store*:
** Fixed a memory leak.
** Apply (very) simple optimizations to lookup expressions.
** Added support for metrics and their “data-stores” (describing how to access
   the actual data references by a metric).
** Added support for querying time-series data through the newly introduced
   “time-series fetcher” plugins.
* *frontend*:
** Fixed a bug that might have caused reading too much data from the
   connection buffer in certain situations.
* *query language*:
** The ‘MATCHING’ clause is now optional in ‘LOOKUP’ queries.
** The ‘LIST’ and ‘FETCH’ commands support ‘FILTER’ clauses as well.
** ‘LIST’ / ‘FETCH’ were changed to ‘LIST hosts’ / ‘FETCH host’.
** Added the ‘TIMESERIES’ command to query arbitrary time-series which fetches
   time-series data from a backend's data-store for a given period of time.
** Added support for date/time values.
** Added support for single quotes in string values: two adjacent single
   quotes may be used to specify a single quote.
* *documentation*:
** Documented the frontend protocol in frontend/proto.h.
** Documented changes to the query language and new / updated plugins.
** Documented all supported data types.

Backends:
~~~~~~~~~
* *collectd::unixsock*:
** The plugin now uses metrics in place of services.
** New config options ‘TimeseriesBackend’ and ‘TimeseriesBaseURL’ to specify
   access to time-series, currently limited to ‘rrdtool’ and ‘rrdcached’
   access.

Plugins:
~~~~~~~~
* *timeseries::rrdtool*:
** New plugin adding support to fetch time-series from local RRD files.
** Supports flushing of values in RRDCacheD.
