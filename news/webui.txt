---------------------------------------------------------------

Early in December, a preview of the web-based SysDB user-interface has been
pushed to link:https://github.com/sysdb/webui[GitHub]. It provides a graphical
client application for browsing and querying the system database.

* Browse all hosts, services, and metrics and display details about them.
* Query hosts, services, and metrics using a simple query language:
** Specify the object-type by name as first word in the query.
** Query by name simply by specifying an (optionally quoted) string which is
   treated as a regex.
** Query by attribute using the <name>:<value> syntax.
* Display graphs for all metrics supporting it. The time-range is configurable
  in the user-interface.
